# Code of Conduct

## Our Commitment

We are committed to maintaining a welcoming and productive environment for all contributors to the Overlord project.

## Standards

Examples of behavior that contributes to a positive environment include:

* Being respectful of differing viewpoints and experiences
* Gracefully accepting constructive criticism
* Focusing on what is best for the community
* Showing empathy towards other community members
* Using welcoming and professional language

Examples of unacceptable behavior include:

* Harassment of any participants
* Publishing others' private information without permission
* Trolling, insulting/derogatory comments, and personal attacks
* Other conduct which could reasonably be considered inappropriate in a professional setting

## Enforcement

Project maintainers are responsible for clarifying the standards of acceptable behavior and are expected to take appropriate and fair corrective action in response to any instances of unacceptable behavior.

Project maintainers have the right and responsibility to remove, edit, or reject comments, commits, code, wiki edits, issues, and other contributions that are not aligned to this Code of Conduct, or to ban temporarily or permanently any contributor for other behaviors that they deem inappropriate, threatening, offensive, or harmful.

## Scope

This Code of Conduct applies within all project spaces, and also applies when an individual is representing the project or its community in public spaces.

## Enforcement

Instances of abusive, harassing, or otherwise unacceptable behavior may be reported by contacting the project team. All complaints will be reviewed and investigated and will result in a response that is deemed necessary and appropriate to the circumstances.

Project maintainers are obligated to maintain confidentiality with regard to the reporter of an incident.
