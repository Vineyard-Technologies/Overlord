## Reporting a Vulnerability

We take security vulnerabilities seriously. If you discover a security vulnerability in Overlord, please report it responsibly.

### How to Report

1. **Do not** open a public issue
2. Email security concerns to: contact@VineyardTechnologies.org
3. Include detailed information about the vulnerability
4. Provide steps to reproduce if possible

### What to Include

- Description of the vulnerability
- Potential impact on system and Daz Studio integration
- Steps to reproduce
- System environment details (OS, Node.js version, Electron version, Daz Studio version)
- Any suggested fixes (optional)
- Your contact information

### Response Timeline

- **Acknowledgment**: Within 48 hours
- **Initial Assessment**: Within 1 week
- **Status Updates**: Weekly until resolved
- **Resolution**: Target within 30 days for critical issues

### Long-Running Application Security

Overlord has unique security considerations as a long-running application:

- Extended exposure time increases attack surface
- System resource access for months of operation
- Integration with external applications (Daz Studio)
- Potential for privilege escalation over time

### Disclosure Policy

- We will work with you to understand and resolve the issue
- We ask that you do not publicly disclose the vulnerability until we have had a chance to address it
- We will credit you for the discovery (unless you prefer to remain anonymous)

- Implement proper session management
- Follow Electron security best practices

### System Integration Security

- Minimize required system privileges
- Secure file system interactions
- Protect configuration files and credentials
- Implement secure inter-process communication
- Monitor system resource usage for anomalies

### Daz Studio Integration Security

- Validate Daz Script execution
- Secure communication with Daz Studio
- Handle Daz Studio crashes gracefully
- Protect against malicious Daz content
- Implement proper error handling for external calls

### Long-Running Security

## Common Security Risks

Be aware of these potential security issues:

- **Privilege Escalation**: Long-running processes with elevated privileges
- **Resource Exhaustion**: Memory leaks or CPU abuse over time
- **File System Access**: Improper file permissions or path traversal
- **Network Communication**: Insecure protocols or exposed endpoints
- **Dependency Vulnerabilities**: Outdated Node.js packages
- **Script Injection**: Malicious Daz Script execution
- **Electron-specific**: Context isolation, nodeIntegration, remote module security

## Dependency Security

- Regularly update Node.js dependencies
- Monitor security advisories for used packages
- Use npm audit to check for vulnerabilities
- Pin dependency versions for stability
- Review new dependencies for security implications

## Configuration Security

- Secure storage of configuration files
- Environment variable security
- Credential management best practices
- Network configuration security
- File permission management
